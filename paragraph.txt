Space control includes offensive space control and defensive space control operations to ensure
freedom of action in space and, when directed, defeat efforts to interfere with or attack US or allied
space systems. Space control uses a broad range of response options to provide continued, sustainable
use of space. Space control contributes to space deterrence by employing a variety of measures to
assure the use of space; attributing enemy attacks; and being consistent with the right to self-defense,
target-threat space capabilities.
